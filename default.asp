<%'<div class='header'>How appallingly a Hipotel receptionist named <br/>Stephanie Leonard treats their customers, which their management did nothing about.</div>%>


<div class='header'>Hipotels appalling treatment of guests by receptionist Stephanie Leonard, which the management did nothing about - despite sending the email
 below to the guests - before then ignoring everything!</div>

 
<div class='blurb'>
The guests turned up to a Hipotel on a Friday evening after travelling all day after having booked 6 months in advance under advice from the receptionist,
 only to find a dirty room, with red stained towels, used bathroom products, no working phone, no working air conditioning and a tree view which was supposed
  to be a sea view, only to be told after complaining to go elsewhere if they didn't like it, despite everywhere being fully booked!<br/><br/>
	
The video below will play until the guests are compensated in full for: <br/><br/>

<b>1)</b> The completely wasted &pound;1,500 in travel costs alone<br/><br/>
<b>2)</b> The complete loss of the 16 night holiday booking which they abandoned after just four nights due to the threats and behaviour
          of the receptionist, as shown in the video below.<br/><br/>
<b>3)</b> Compensation for the whole unecessary stress they were put through by a company who clearly doesn't appear to give a damn.<br/><br/>

Despite EEC agreeing that the Hotel had behaved appallingly and trying to get Hipotels to reimburse the guests, the Company Director ignored
 them - which shows contempt they hold guests and the authorities in.

	Hello David,<br/><br/>
	
	I have taken your incident very seriously. I understand your annoyance at the hotel and later.<br/><br/>
	This is the reason why I decided to call you.<br/><br/>
	
	I am sure that my colleagues in Natura Palace have tried to do the best, but this time we have not right.<br/><br/>
	
	Please accept our apologies.<br/><br/>
	
	David, with video and without video from Hipotels consider this incident and all the customer reviews very seriously.<br/><br/>
	
	We are going to examine the videos and your emails and we will take the best solutions for both.<br/><br/>
	
	At this point I have to say that our company works hard to give the best service to our customers and 
	 a video does not do justice to the effort that most of us do every day to provide our customers the best.<br/><br/>
	 
	 The solutions are different. I would like to know what do you think is the solution we must take with you?. Note that today is Saturday and Hipotels Mallorca is closed.<br/><br/>
	 
	 I would like to know your suggestions between today and tomorrow so that I can speak with Mallorca on Monday morning.<br/><br/>
	 
	 I hope your comments, again receive our apologies.<br/><br/>
	 
	 I send you my best wishes<br/><br/>
	 
	 
	 Francisco Martinez<br/>
	 Director<br/>
	 Hipotels<br/>
	 Telef&#243;no: 928 510 441<br/>
	 M&#243;vil: +34 678 120 040

<div class='blurb'>
  <br/><br/>And despite this very sincere email - There has been no reply and nothing has been done.<br/><br/>
	Given the problems, tourists may want to avoid hipotels in the near future!
